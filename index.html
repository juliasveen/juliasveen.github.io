          Welcome to my website/personal porfolio! I am a recent graduate of Florida State University, where I earned a B.S. in Information, Communication & Technology, along with minors in Computer Science and Mathematics. I’ll be continuing at FSU this fall as a Master’s student in the Information Technology program.
          I currently work as an IT Help Desk Technician at FSU’s College of Communication & Information, providing technical support across Windows and Mac platforms. 
          I’m passionate about data science, analytics, machine learning, and creative web development—both front-end and back-end—and I’m always excited to explore new technologies and tools. Beyond tech, you can often find me keeping up with the MLB and any FSU sports team, listening to music, thrifting, or scouring the internet for new recipes.

        <h3>Attendance Case Study - Dodger Stadium Analysis</h3>
        <p>As someone passionate about baseball, I conducted a data analysis project on attendance patterns at Dodgers Stadium from 2014 to 2022. My goal was to determine how factors like team performance, specific opponents, and seasonal trends impacted the percentage of stadium capacity filled. I was responsible for the entire analysis process, including data cleaning, merging datasets, and building statistical models in R. I developed multiple regression models to predict attendance trends and evaluated their accuracy using R-squared values, MAE, and RMSE. This project allowed me to apply my data analysis skills to a real-world scenario and provide insights that could help optimize attendance strategies.</p></a>

        <h3>Amazon Redesign Prototype</h3>
        <p>For this project, I redesigned the Amazon website with a focus on improving the user experience. I aimed to declutter the interface, simplify navigation, and introduce features that enhance usability. I incorporated elements like a more intuitive menu, voice search functionality, and AI-based product suggestions to make shopping more efficient. My role involved designing the prototype, ensuring interactive elements worked smoothly, and refining the overall structure to create a more seamless and user-friendly experience.</p></a>

My role involved structuring the site, implementing dynamic features, and managing version control through GitHub. This project helped me refine my web development skills while establishing an online presence to share my work.</p></a>
